Here's a structured plan for setting up your development (DEV) and production (PROD) environments using AWS:

---

### **1. General Planning**
1. **Define Environment Needs**:
   - **DEV**: For testing, debugging, and development. Likely lower resource allocation.
   - **PROD**: For live user interaction. Requires high reliability and scalability.
2. **Components Per Environment**:
   - EC2 for backend hosting.
   - S3 for file storage.
   - MongoDB Atlas for the database.
   - AWS Secret Manager for secure key management.

---

### **2. Setting Up AWS Components**

#### **2.1. EC2 Instances (Dockerized Backend)**
1. **Plan Resources**:
   - Choose instance types (e.g., `t2.micro` for DEV, `t3.medium` for PROD depending on load).
2. **Create EC2 Instances**:
   - Separate instances for DEV and PROD.
   - Set up SSH keys for secure access.
3. **Install Docker**:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on the instances.
   - Ensure ports (e.g., 3000 or 8080 for your backend) are open in security groups.
4. **Automate Deployment**:
   - Use a deployment script (e.g., Bash) or CI/CD pipeline for uploading and running Docker containers.

---

#### **2.2. S3 (File Storage)**
1. **Create Buckets**:
   - One bucket for DEV (`my-app-dev-files`).
   - One bucket for PROD (`my-app-prod-files`).
   - Enable versioning and encryption for security.
2. **Set Permissions**:
   - Restrict access with bucket policies or IAM roles.
   - Grant backend access via AWS SDKs.

---

#### **2.3. MongoDB Atlas**
1. **Cluster Setup**:
   - Use the Atlas console to set up DEV and PROD clusters.
   - Select appropriate tiers (e.g., `M0` for DEV, `M10+` for PROD).
2. **Network Access**:
   - Whitelist IPs of your EC2 instances.
   - Set up VPC Peering for secure connection.
3. **Environment Separation**:
   - Use separate databases or collections for DEV and PROD.
4. **Backup and Monitoring**:
   - Configure backups and enable monitoring.

---

#### **2.4. AWS Secret Manager (Secrets Management)**
1. **Store Secrets**:
   - MongoDB connection strings, API keys, or sensitive configs.
2. **Environment Segmentation**:
   - Separate secrets for DEV and PROD.
   - Use naming conventions (e.g., `my-app-dev-mongo` and `my-app-prod-mongo`).
3. **Integration**:
   - Use AWS SDK in your backend to fetch secrets dynamically.
   - Rotate secrets periodically for security.

---

### **3. Deployment Workflow**

#### **3.1. Backend Deployment with Docker**
1. **Dockerize Backend**:
   - Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize your app.
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container setups if necessary.
2. **Push to Repository**:
   - Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
3. **Pull & Deploy**:
   - Pull the appropriate image on the respective EC2 instance.
   - Run containers using Docker commands or `docker-compose`.

---

#### **3.2. CI/CD Pipeline**
1. **Choose Tools**:
   - Use GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, or other CI/CD tools.
2. **Automate Steps**:
   - Build, test, and push Docker images to the registry.
   - Deploy to EC2 automatically upon new commits.
3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `.env` files or Secret Manager for each environment.

---

### **4. Access & Security**
1. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - Assign roles to EC2 instances for S3 and Secret Manager access.
2. **SSL Certificates**:
   - Use AWS Certificate Manager for HTTPS.
3. **Security Groups**:
   - Restrict access to only necessary ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS).
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Use CloudWatch to monitor EC2, S3, and other AWS resources.

---

### **5. Testing and Final Steps**
1. **Test DEV Environment**:
   - Verify all components (EC2, S3, MongoDB, Secret Manager) work as expected.
   - Test deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Clone for PROD**:
   - Duplicate the setup for PROD, scaling resources appropriately.
3. **Document**:
   - Keep clear documentation of architecture, processes, and configurations.
